# wordfoo

This searches permutations of letters in a wordlist.

I made this to automate 8 Cats Out Of 10 Does Countdown, pre-ad riddles,
when I can't figure them out myself. It's usually pretty easy to pick
out the desired word.

Takes 70-100ms per run on my machine, not bad! (8 words, ~40k permutations)

# License

The code is CC0. I haven't been able to ascertain the license of the wordlist,
but it's derived entirely from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html
